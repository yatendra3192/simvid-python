# CLAUDE.md - Project Context for Aiezzy Simvid

## Project Overview
**Aiezzy Simvid** (formerly SimVid Python) - A web-based slideshow video generator that creates MP4 videos from images with background music. Built with Flask (Python) backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend.

## Current Status (As of 2025-09-28 - End of Day Update)

### What's Working âœ…
- âœ… Python Flask server running successfully at http://localhost:5000
- âœ… Deployed to Railway at https://web-production-5b632.up.railway.app
- âœ… GitHub repository at https://github.com/yatendra3192/simvid-python
- âœ… **IMAGE UPLOAD FIXED** - Complete rewrite, now working perfectly!
- âœ… Drag & drop image upload working
- âœ… Click to browse file selection working
- âœ… Image preview with remove functionality
- âœ… YouTube audio download (using yt-dlp)
- âœ… Auto-download YouTube audio on video generation
- âœ… Image orientation fixed (EXIF data handled)
- âœ… Wake Lock API prevents mobile screen sleep
- âœ… **YouTube Audio Time Selection** - Can specify start/end times (e.g., 0:30 to 1:10)
- âœ… **Admin Dashboard** - Complete admin panel with authentication
- âœ… **App Rebranded** - Changed from "SimVid Python" to "Aiezzy Simvid"
- âœ… Clean, simplified UI with better UX

### All Major Issues Now Fixed! ðŸŽ‰
1. **Video Generation with Audio** âœ…
   - MoviePy v2.x compatibility resolved with fallback methods
   - Audio trimming working with proper validation
   - Videos generate WITH audio successfully

2. **FFmpeg Dependency** âœ…
   - yt-dlp handles audio without FFmpeg conversion
   - Working on both local and Railway deployment

## Today's Development Sessions (2025-09-28 - Full Day)

### Major Fixes Implemented

#### 1. **FIXED: Image Upload Not Working** âœ…
- **Problem**: Multiple issues - reference errors, timing problems, complex broken code
- **Solution**: Complete rewrite of index.html
  - Removed all inline onclick handlers
  - All functions defined in DOMContentLoaded
  - Simplified handleImageFiles function
  - Used URL.createObjectURL for instant previews
  - Clean event listener setup
- **Result**: Upload now works perfectly via click and drag & drop

#### 2. **FIXED: Image Orientation Issue** âœ…
- **Problem**: Vertical photos from phones appearing horizontal in videos
- **Solution**: Added EXIF orientation handling
  ```python
  def fix_image_orientation(img):
      # Reads EXIF orientation tag
      # Rotates image accordingly (90Â°, 180Â°, 270Â°)
  ```
- **Result**: Phone photos now maintain correct orientation

#### 3. **UI/UX Improvements** âœ…
- **Simplified Audio Workflow**:
  - Removed separate "Download Audio" button
  - YouTube audio now downloads automatically during video generation
  - One-click process instead of two steps
- **Better Error Handling**:
  - Added warning status for non-critical issues
  - Graceful fallback if audio download fails
- **Clearer Instructions**:
  - Added helpful text explaining automatic features

## Key Technical Details

### Wake Lock Implementation
```javascript
// Prevents screen sleep during processing
let wakeLock = null;
async function requestWakeLock() {
    if ('wakeLock' in navigator) {
        wakeLock = await navigator.wakeLock.request('screen');
    }
}
```

### Timeout Handling
```javascript
// 5-minute timeout for video generation
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 300000);
```

### Console Debugging
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Check Console tab for detailed logs
- Every step of file handling is logged

## Testing Checklist

### Local Testing âœ…
- [x] Server starts on port 5000
- [x] Image upload via click
- [x] Image upload via drag & drop
- [x] YouTube audio download
- [x] Image preview display
- [x] Image orientation preserved
- [x] Video generation (works but without audio)

### Deployment Testing âœ…
- [x] Railway deployment successful
- [x] Server accessible via public URL
- [x] Mobile screen sleep prevention
- [x] Image upload functionality - FIXED!
- [x] Drag and drop working
- [x] YouTube URL auto-download
- [ ] Video generation with audio (MoviePy issue)

## Tomorrow's Priority Tasks

### CRITICAL - Must Fix
1. **Fix MoviePy Audio Integration**
   - Current issue: Videos generate without audio
   - Error: `'AudioFileClip' object has no attribute 'subclip'`
   - Solutions to try:
     ```python
     # Option 1: Use set_duration instead of subclip
     audio_clip = AudioFileClip(audio_path).set_duration(video.duration)

     # Option 2: Downgrade MoviePy
     pip install moviepy==1.0.3

     # Option 3: Use different audio method
     from moviepy.audio.io.AudioFileClip import AudioFileClip
     ```

2. **Add FFmpeg to Railway Deployment**
   - Create nixpacks.toml with ffmpeg
   - Or use buildpack with ffmpeg included
   - Required for proper audio/video processing

### Nice to Have
3. **Add Video Generation Progress**
   - Real-time progress updates during generation
   - Show estimated time remaining
   - Better user feedback during long operations

4. **Add More Transitions**
   - Currently only fade works
   - Add slide, zoom, dissolve effects
   - Make transition duration adjustable

5. **Optimize for Large Videos**
   - Add chunked processing for many images
   - Implement queue system for multiple requests
   - Add file size warnings
